# Docker

Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development – desktop and cloud. Docker’s comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.

## Install Docker

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
